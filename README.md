# Spicetify Private Session

Spicetify Private Session is a simple Spicetify extension that will always enable private session. 

## How it works
- On window initialization, try to find the Private Session indicator button to determine if we're already in private mode
- If we're not already listening in private mode, open the main menu, and select the Private Session menu item to activate private session
